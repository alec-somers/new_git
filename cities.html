        <li>Tacoma, WA</li>

      </ul>
      <p>
        I was born in Owatonna, MN and lived there pretty much my entire life
        until I joined the army. Once I left, I ended up being stationed up in
        Washington state. In WA, I initially lived near Tacoma, but then I ended
        up moving to Lacey, WA where I live now.

      <p>
        I've never really taken advantage of traveling abroad and would like to
        start at least with these three places.
